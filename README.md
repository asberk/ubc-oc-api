# Accessing UBC Open Collections API using Python

## Summary

This is going to be some brainstorming for the August bcdata workshop. We'll be
looking to come up with some kind of project using this data that could be used
as an afternoon project for the participants. Also, I'm intrigued about what we
can make the API do!
